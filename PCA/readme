Outputs:
(a) Display the fourth face in the dataset using the appropriate command above. Print the resulting display.
(b) Compute the mean of all the examples in the dataset fea.
(That is, compute an image such that each pixel i of the image is the mean of pixel i in all the images in fea.)
Display it using a modification of the above command. Give the Python commands you used and show the resulting display.
(c) Let's do dimensionality reduction with pca. Using Python, compute the 5 top principal components of the data matrix fea.
Give the Python commands you used. What are the values of the associated 5 attributes of the fourth image in the dataset?
(d) Project the fourth face in the dataset onto the first 5 principle components.
(e) Project the fourth face back into the original space.
Give the Python commands you used. Display the resulting approximate image and print the resulting display.
Repeat with the first 50 principle components (instead of 5).
(These are representations of the fourth image, based on 5 or 50 features instead of the original 2914 pixel features.)
