predict if a fish is from Alaska or Canada based on two features:
x1 = diameter of rings for first-year freshwater growth (in hundredths of an inch)
x2 = diameter of rings for first-year marine growth (in hundredths of an inch)

use the salmon dataset that was given in the file Salmon Dataset.csv:
The first line in the file contains the header information.
Each subsequent line in the file gives the information for one example.
Each example in the file has three features (and an index).

output the following values and write them to a separate text file (or the standard output):
1. The estimated mu0 and sigma0 of the Gaussian for the Alaskan salmon
2. The estimated mu1 and sigma1 of the Gaussian for the Canadian salmon
3. The predicted class (Alaskan or Canadian) of the fish
