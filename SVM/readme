Answer the following questions for the data matrix X and labels y given in the files X.csv and y.csv:
(a) what are the weights computed by the SVM primal problem
(b) which of the training examples are closest to the decision boundary in the SVM primal problem
(c) what is the decision function fprimal(x)
(d) using the decision function from (c), what are the labels of (3.0, 1.5)T and (1.2, 3.0)T
(e) After solving the SVM dual problem, which are the support vectors, and what are their corresponding alpha values
(f) what is the decision function fdual(x)
(g) using the decision function from (f), what are the labels of (3.0, 1.5)T and (1.2, 3.0)T
