1. Select a Machine Learning algorithm.
2. Head over to sklearn and find its implementation of this algorithm.
Find some extensions of the basic algorithm implemented by sklearn that improve performance, and implement it yourself.
3. Find datasets of your choice that also perform better with your new extensions.

Basic algorithm: Logistic Regression
Extensions: Random Forest & Feature Selection
Datasets: diabetes.csv & load_breast_cancer from Sklearn

p.s. If Scikit-learn does not support your algorithm, you may consider other libraries (example: PyTorch, Tensorflow).
