estimate the price of a house in Boston using 13 attributes:
Fit a ridge regression model using the closed solution.
Use 10-fold cross validation to find the best lambda = [10^1, 10^1.5, 10^2, 10^2.5,..., 10^7].
Use the Numpy function: np.logspace(1, 7, num=13) to get the different values for lambda.
For the best lambda you found, use 10-fold cross validation to estimate the performance of this model with this lambda.
Select the best hyperparameter using MSE.

Repeat the previous exercise by creating a polynomial transformation of degree 2 on the features of the dataset.
